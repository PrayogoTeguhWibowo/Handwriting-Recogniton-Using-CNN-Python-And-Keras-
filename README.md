# Handwriting-Recogniton-Using-CNN-Python-And-Keras-
Repository of Project Handwriting Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network Method Using Python and Keras framework

For this Handwriting Recognition, make sure you are using Python 3.6 and above. Install the required library, place the .py file, the model either .h5 or .json and the image to be recognized in 1 folder. as a note. the image you used must be a clean image (the background must be completely white, and the writing must be completely black) do not let any shaded areas or the recognition results will be error or inaccurate
